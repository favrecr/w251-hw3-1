## Overview
Thhis repo contains the components of a lightweight IoT application pipeline that collects images of faces detected from a webcam feed on an edge device (the Nvidia Jetson TX2) and transmits them to the cloud to be processed and stored (aIBM CLoud Object Store).

## Implementation Details
All components are implemented as containerized applications deployed on the edge device (to capture and forward image) and the cloud (to receive, process and store). MQTT proticik us ysed for communication and transmitting images across components.
